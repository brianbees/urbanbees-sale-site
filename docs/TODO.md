## PayPal Checkout Enhancement

**Request:** Remove the requirement for customers to manually type their order details into the PayPal note.

**Goal:** Update the checkout logic so that the Cart Summary (items, quantities, and IDs) is sent directly to the payment provider's metadata. Order details should show up automatically in the seller dashboard when a payment is completed.

**Status:** Pending implementation
