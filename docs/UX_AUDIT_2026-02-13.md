---

## 1. Navigation Clarity and Ease of Use

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Clear header structure** with logo and cart/wishlist icons
- **Back buttons** consistently placed on all subpages
- **Breadcrumb-like navigation** through back buttons works well

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 1.1: No Homepage Link from Product Pages
**Problem:** On product detail pages, clicking the "Back" button uses browser history, which may not return users to the homepage if they arrived via direct link.

**Why It Matters:** Users arriving from external links (email, social media) have no clear way to navigate to the main product catalog without using browser controls.

**Recommendation:**
- Add the Urban Bees logo as a clickable link to `/` in the Header
- Currently the logo is in a `Link` component but users may not know it's clickable
- Add hover effect to logo to indicate it's interactive

#### Issue 1.2: No Active Navigation State
**Problem:** When viewing cart or wishlist pages, there's no visual indication that the user is on that page (header icons don't change appearance).

**Why It Matters:** Users lose spatial awareness of where they are in the site structure, especially on mobile where page titles may be below the fold.

**Recommendation:**
- Add active state styling to header cart/wishlist icons when on those pages
- Consider adding a subtle background highlight or border-bottom indicator
- Example: `className={pathname === '/cart' ? 'bg-gray-100 border-b-2 border-blue-600' : ''}`

#### Issue 1.3: Search Results Don't Indicate Query
**Problem:** After searching, there's no visual confirmation of what search term is active (input shows the term but no "Searching for: X" message).

**Why It Matters:** Users may forget what they searched for, especially after scrolling. Makes it harder to refine searches.

**Recommendation:**
- Add a results header: "Showing {count} results for '{searchTerm}'"
- Display near the product count, styled as secondary information
- Include in the "Clear filters" area

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy and Layout Consistency

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Consistent card-based design** across product listings
- **Clear price emphasis** with larger, bold font
- **Good color hierarchy** using gray tones for secondary info

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 2.1: Inconsistent Spacing Between Pages
**Problem:** 
- Homepage uses `py-6 md:py-12` container padding
- Cart page uses `py-8` padding
- Wishlist page uses `py-8` padding
- Product detail uses `p-4 md:p-8`

**Why It Matters:** Creates subtle visual jarring when navigating between pages. Professional sites maintain consistent rhythm.

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize on a spacing scale (e.g., `py-8` for all pages, `py-12` for homepage hero)
- Create a layout wrapper component that enforces consistent spacing
- Consider: `<PageContainer size="standard">` with predefined spacing options

#### Issue 2.2: Heading Size Inconsistency
**Problem:**
- Homepage: `text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl` (main heading)
- Cart: `text-3xl` (page heading)
- Wishlist: `text-3xl` (page heading)
- Product Detail: `text-2xl lg:text-3xl` (product name)

**Why It Matters:** Lack of typographic hierarchy makes it harder for users to scan pages and understand content importance.

**Recommendation:**
- Establish a heading scale:
  - H1 (page titles): `text-3xl md:text-4xl`
  - H2 (section titles): `text-2xl md:text-3xl`
  - H3 (card titles): `text-lg md:text-xl`
- Document this in a typography component or Tailwind config

#### Issue 2.3: Product Card Layout Changes Between Views
**Problem:**
- Homepage cards: Horizontal layout (image left, details right)
- Product detail thumbnails: Grid layout
- No visual consistency in aspect ratios

**Why It Matters:** While intentional, the dramatic layout shift from horizontal cards to vertical detail page can be disorienting.

**Recommendation:**
- Maintain visual continuity by using similar aspect ratios
- Consider adding a subtle background color to product detail page that matches card backgrounds
- Ensure image aspect ratios are consistent (currently 128x144 vs 400x500)

---

## 3. Button Placement, Spacing, and Interaction Feedback

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Good loading states** with spinner animations on Add to Cart
- **Clear hover effects** on most interactive elements
- **Disabled states** properly implemented with visual feedback

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 3.1: Small Touch Targets on Mobile
**Problem:**
- Variant selector buttons: `py-1 px-2` (product cards)
- Quantity +/- buttons: `w-9 h-9` (36x36px - below 44px minimum)
- Wishlist heart in card: `h-5 w-5` with `p-1.5` padding = ~32px total

**Why It Matters:** WCAG 2.1 recommends minimum 44x44px touch targets. Users with limited dexterity or on mobile will have difficulty.

**Recommendation:**
- Increase quantity buttons to `w-11 h-11` (44px minimum)
- Variant buttons: `py-2 px-3` minimum on mobile
- Heart button: `p-2` minimum, making total size ~40px

#### Issue 3.2: Inconsistent Button Styles
**Problem:**
- Add to Cart: `bg-blue-600` with multiple size classes
- Continue Shopping: Sometimes `bg-gray-100`, sometimes `text-blue-600 underline`
- PayPal button: Different styling (external component)
- Remove button: Plain text with `text-red-600`

**Why It Matters:** Users need to learn different visual patterns for different button types, increasing cognitive load.

**Recommendation:**
- Define button hierarchy:
  - **Primary:** Blue filled (`bg-blue-600`) for main actions
  - **Secondary:** Gray outlined (`border-2 border-gray-300`) for alternatives
  - **Tertiary:** Text-only with icon for less important actions
  - **Destructive:** Red filled (`bg-red-600`) for Remove/Delete actions
- Create button component that enforces consistent sizing and styling

#### Issue 3.3: No Focus Indicators on Custom Buttons
**Problem:** Custom styled buttons (variant selectors, quantity controls) don't show clear focus rings for keyboard navigation.

**Why It Matters:** Keyboard users (accessibility requirement) cannot see where they are when tabbing through the interface.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2` to all interactive elements
- Ensure focus indicators are visible against all backgrounds
- Test with keyboard-only navigation

#### Issue 3.4: Toast Notification Lacks Dismiss Button
**Problem:** "Added to cart" toast requires clicking one of two action buttons - no quick dismiss/close option.

**Why It Matters:** Users who don't want to take action must wait for auto-dismiss or click away from their workflow.

**Recommendation:**
- Add X button in top-right corner of toast
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds (currently missing - toasts persist)
- Add slideIn/slideOut animations for polish

#### Issue 3.5: Multiple CTAs Compete for Attention
**Problem:** Product cards have 5-6 interactive elements in a small space:
- Wishlist heart (top-right)
- Entire card is a link
- Variant selector buttons
- Add to Cart button
- Wishlist button (again, at bottom)

**Why It Matters:** Too many choices create decision paralysis. Users don't know what the primary action should be.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove duplicate wishlist button at bottom (keep only top-right heart)
- Make only the image + title clickable (not entire card) to reduce accidental navigation
- Increase visual prominence of "Add to Cart" as primary action

---

## 4. Form Usability and Validation

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Search input has placeholder** text
- **Input focus states** are visually clear
- **Select dropdowns** are properly styled

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 4.1: Search Input Lacks Clear Button
**Problem:** Search input has no magnifying glass icon or "Search" button - users must type and rely on real-time filtering.

**Why It Matters:** Visual cue helps users understand it's a search field. Some users expect to press Enter or click a button.

**Recommendation:**
- Add magnifying glass icon inside input (left side)
- Add small "X" button to clear search when active (right side)
- Support Enter key to "submit" search (even if it just triggers the existing filter)

#### Issue 4.2: No Input Validation Feedback
**Problem:** Quantity inputs in cart have no min/max indicators or validation messages.

**Why It Matters:** Users can try to set quantity to 100 when only 5 are in stock - no warning until checkout attempt.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `max` attribute to quantity controls based on stock
- Show validation message when user tries to exceed stock: "Only {stock} available"
- Disable + button when at max quantity
- Show current stock level near quantity control

#### Issue 4.3: Filter Dropdowns Don't Show Selection Count
**Problem:** When category filter is active, dropdown shows selected value but doesn't indicate how many products match.

**Why It Matters:** Users don't know if their filter is too restrictive without looking at results.

**Recommendation:**
- Add count badges to dropdown options: "Hive Components (12)"
- Show active filter chips below dropdowns with remove ability
- Example: `[Beehive Equipment ×]`

---

## 5. Product Page Readability and Link Rendering

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Clickable links** properly implemented in descriptions
- **Good line spacing** in description text
- **Clear section headings** (Description, Features)

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 5.1: Description Links Not Visually Distinct Until Hover
**Problem:** Links in descriptions are blue but lack underline, making them hard to distinguish from text at a glance.

**Why It Matters:** Users may not realize there are clickable links, missing important information or external resources.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `underline` class to all description links by default
- Consider adding icon for external links: `↗`
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratio (currently 4.5:1, should be 7:1 for AA)

#### Issue 5.2: Long URLs Break Layout
**Problem:** Even with URL shortening, some links may still wrap awkwardly or break layout on mobile.

**Why It Matters:** Horizontal scrolling or text overflow damages readability and professional appearance.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `break-all` or `break-words` to link containers
- Consider showing shortened display text with full URL on hover
- Example: `[Click here]` displays as link text instead of URL

#### Issue 5.3: Description Formatting Lost
**Problem:** Multi-line descriptions show line breaks but lack paragraph spacing for longer content.

**Why It Matters:** Long descriptions become hard to read without visual separation.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `space-y-3` to description containers for paragraph spacing
- Support Markdown-style formatting (**, *, - for lists)
- Consider adding a "Read more" toggle for descriptions over 200 words

---

## 6. Cart and Checkout Flow Clarity

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Real-time stock warnings** in cart
- **Clear order summary** with itemized totals
- **Disabled checkout** when stock issues exist

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 6.1: No Visual Checkout Steps/Progress
**Problem:** Cart page has PayPal button but no indication of what happens after payment or how many steps are involved.

**Why It Matters:** Users feel uncertain about the process, leading to cart abandonment.

**Recommendation:**
- Add progress indicator: `Cart → Checkout → Confirmation`
- Show "You are here: Step 1 of 2" type indicator
- Add informational text: "Next: You'll be redirected to PayPal to complete payment"

#### Issue 6.2: Stock Warnings Are Subtle
**Problem:** Stock warnings use yellow background which doesn't grab attention. Red warnings use similar styling.

**Why It Matters:** Users may miss critical blocking issues and wonder why PayPal button is disabled.

**Recommendation:**
- Use more prominent styling for blocking issues:
  - Red border + red background for out-of-stock
  - Yellow for warnings, red for errors
- Add icon to grab attention: ⚠️ or 🚫
- Move warning above PayPal button for visibility

#### Issue 6.3: No "Save for Later" Option
**Problem:** Users can only delete items or checkout - no middle ground.

**Why It Matters:** Users may want to clear cart but keep some items for later consideration.

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Move to Wishlist" button next to "Remove"
- Alternative: Add "Save for Later" feature separate from wishlist
- Show saved items count in cart if any exist

#### Issue 6.4: Cart Total Missing Shipping/Tax Information
**Problem:** Order summary shows only subtotal = total, no mention of shipping.

**Why It Matters:** Users expect transparency about final cost before entering payment details.

**Recommendation:**
- Add placeholder line: "Shipping: Calculated at checkout"
- Add tax information if applicable
- Show estimated total range if shipping varies
- Add info tooltip explaining what's included

#### Issue 6.5: No Promo Code/Coupon Field
**Problem:** No way to apply discount codes if they exist.

**Why It Matters:** Standard e-commerce feature users expect. May have received promotional codes via email.

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Have a promo code?" collapsible section above PayPal button
- Include validation feedback (invalid code, expired, etc.)
- Show applied discount in order summary

---

## 7. Mobile Responsiveness and Touch-Target Sizing

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Responsive grid layouts** adjust properly
- **Mobile-first design** approach visible in code
- **Touch-friendly** wishlist heart buttons

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 7.1: Product Card Buttons Too Small on Mobile
**Problem:** 
- Add to Cart button: `py-1.5 px-3` on mobile (roughly 32px height)
- Variant buttons: `py-1 px-2` (roughly 28px height)
- Both below 44px minimum touch target

**Why It Matters:** Primary actions are difficult to tap accurately, causing frustration and mis-taps.

**Recommendation:**
- Mobile-specific classes: `py-3 px-4 md:py-2 md:px-3`
- Ensures 44px minimum height on mobile
- Desktop can use smaller sizing for information density

#### Issue 7.2: Horizontal Scroll on Filters
**Problem:** Filter row uses `overflow-x-auto` which works but isn't discoverable on desktop.

**Why It Matters:** Users may not realize more filters exist off-screen. Breaks desktop UX expectations.

**Recommendation:**
- On desktop: Show all filters in a flexbox that wraps
- On mobile: Keep horizontal scroll but add subtle fade gradient on edges
- Add "Show more filters" button if many categories exist

#### Issue 7.3: Product Images Not Optimized for Mobile Bandwidth
**Problem:** Images use `unoptimized` prop, serving full-size images even on mobile.

**Why It Matters:** Users on slow connections wait longer, consuming unnecessary data. Especially problematic for edited images which are smaller but still unoptimized.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove `unoptimized` prop and fix the underlying Next.js Image optimization issue
- Serve different image sizes based on viewport (Next.js handles this by default)
- Add loading="lazy" for images below the fold

#### Issue 7.4: Text Too Small on Mobile in Product Cards
**Problem:**
- Description: `text-xs` (12px) on mobile
- Category badge: `text-xs` on mobile
- Below 14px recommended minimum for body text

**Why It Matters:** Readability issues, especially for users with vision impairments.

**Recommendation:**
- Increase mobile text: `text-sm md:text-xs` for secondary information
- Maintain hierarchy but ensure legibility
- Test on actual devices, not just browser DevTools

#### Issue 7.5: Modal Lightbox Difficult to Close on Mobile
**Problem:** Close button is small (4xl font) and positioned in corner - hard to reach with thumb on large phones.

**Why It Matters:** One-handed mobile use requires easy-to-reach buttons. Top corners are hardest to reach.

**Recommendation:**
- Add close button at bottom of screen as well
- Make entire backdrop area closable (already implemented, but could be clearer)
- Add swipe-down gesture to close
- Show instruction: "Tap anywhere or swipe to close"

---

## 8. Loading States, Error States, and Empty States

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Skeleton loading** on homepage shows structure
- **Empty cart message** with CTA
- **Error page** with retry button
- **Add-to-Cart loading spinner** clearly visible

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 8.1: No Loading State for Cart Stock Check
**Problem:** When cart page loads, stock validation happens silently in background - no indication to user.

**Why It Matters:** Users may start editing cart before stock check completes, potentially missing warnings.

**Recommendation:**
- Show skeleton placeholders for cart items during initial load
- Add "Checking stock availability..." message with spinner
- Disable quantity controls until stock verification completes

#### Issue 8.2: Error Messages Use Generic Alert()
**Problem:** Stock errors, timeout errors, all use browser `alert()` which:
- Blocks the entire UI
- Looks unprofessional
- Can't be styled
- May be blocked by some browsers

**Why It Matters:** Poor UX for error handling. Users can't continue browsing while alert is open.

**Recommendation:**
- Create toast notification system for errors (non-blocking)
- Use color coding: red for errors, yellow for warnings
- Add icons for visual scanning
- Allow dismissal and auto-dismiss after 8-10 seconds

#### Issue 8.3: No Empty State for Wishlist Items
**Problem:** Wishlist empty state exists but lacks personality/illustration.

**Why It Matters:** Empty states are opportunities to guide users toward action with engaging visuals.

**Recommendation:**
- Add illustration or animation to empty states
- Include benefits: "Save items to compare prices later"
- Add quick links to popular categories
- Consider showing "Recently viewed" products

#### Issue 8.4: Loading Skeleton Doesn't Match Actual Content
**Problem:** Homepage loading shows 4-column grid (`lg:grid-cols-4`) but products display as vertical list.

**Why It Matters:** Mismatch creates jarring experience when content loads. Called "layout shift."

**Recommendation:**
- Skeleton should match actual eBay-style horizontal cards
- Show same number of items as typical page (8-10)
- Match card height to reduce cumulative layout shift (CLS)

#### Issue 8.5: No Network Error Handling
**Problem:** If Supabase request fails on homepage, users see empty products array with no error message.

**Why It Matters:** Users don't know if site is broken or if there are genuinely no products.

**Recommendation:**
- Add error boundary for database failures
- Show error state: "Unable to load products" with retry button
- Log errors to monitoring service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Add offline mode detection with appropriate message

---

## 9. Accessibility (Contrast, Keyboard Navigation, ARIA)

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Semantic HTML** (header, main, buttons)
- **Alt text** on product images
- **aria-label** on some buttons

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 9.1: Insufficient Color Contrast
**Problem:** 
- Gray text (`text-gray-600`) on white: ~4.54:1 ratio (needs 4.5:1 minimum)
- Blue links (`text-blue-600`) on white: ~4.5:1 (borderline)
- Category badge (`text-gray-500`): ~3.5:1 (fails WCAG AA)

**Why It Matters:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text. Users with vision impairments struggle to read low-contrast text.

**Recommendation:**
- Darken secondary text: `text-gray-700` instead of `text-gray-600`
- Use `text-blue-700` for links
- Verify all text colors using contrast checker tool
- Add to design system documentation

#### Issue 9.2: Missing Skip Navigation Link
**Problem:** No "Skip to main content" link for keyboard/screen reader users.

**Why It Matters:** Keyboard users must tab through entire header on every page before reaching content.

**Recommendation:**
- Add skip link as first element: `<a href="#main-content" class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to main content</a>`
- Make visible on focus for keyboard users
- Link to main content area with `id="main-content"`

#### Issue 9.3: Images Missing Comprehensive Alt Text
**Problem:** Product images use generic alt: `{product.name}` or "No image"

**Why It Matters:** Screen reader users don't get descriptive information about product appearance.

**Recommendation:**
- Improve alt text: "{product.name} - {brief visual description}"
- Example: "Clearer Board (5 Cone, Cedar) - rectangular wooden board with 5 bee escape cones"
- For edited images, maintain descriptive alt text
- Empty decorative images should have `alt=""`

#### Issue 9.4: Form Labels Not Properly Associated
**Problem:** Search input has placeholder but no proper `<label>` element with `for` attribute.

**Why It Matters:** Screen readers can't announce what the input is for. Clicking label won't focus input.

**Recommendation:**
- Add visually hidden label: `<label htmlFor="product-search" className="sr-only">Search products</label>`
- Associate with input: `<input id="product-search" ...>`
- Same for all form inputs (category, sort dropdowns)

#### Issue 9.5: No ARIA Live Regions for Dynamic Content
**Problem:** When products filter/sort, screen readers aren't notified of changes.

**Why It Matters:** Screen reader users don't know content has updated without re-scanning page.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `aria-live="polite"` to results count div
- Announce filter changes: "Showing 5 products in category Beehive Equipment"
- Add `aria-busy="true"` during loading states
- Use `role="status"` for toast notifications

#### Issue 9.6: Keyboard Focus Not Visible Everywhere
**Problem:** Some custom styled buttons lose default focus indicator.

**Why It Matters:** Keyboard users can't see where they are in the interface.

**Recommendation:**
- Add focus rings to all interactive elements
- Use `focus-visible:` to show only for keyboard (not mouse clicks)
- Test full site with keyboard only (no mouse)
- Add focus indicator to main content area

#### Issue 9.7: Modal Lightbox Not Accessible
**Problem:**
- No focus trap (keyboard users can tab out of modal)
- Escape key not handled
- No focus management when opening/closing

**Why It Matters:** Keyboard users get lost, screen readers read background content.

**Recommendation:**
- Trap focus within modal when open
- Add Escape key listener to close
- Focus close button when opening
- Return focus to triggering element when closing
- Add `aria-modal="true"` and `role="dialog"`

---

## 10. Performance Issues Affecting Perceived Responsiveness

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Image lazy loading** on lower cards
- **Priority loading** for above-fold images
- **ISR caching** (5-minute homepage cache)

### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 10.1: Unoptimized Images Hurt Performance
**Problem:** `unoptimized` prop bypasses Next.js image optimization, serving full-size JPEGs.

**Why It Matters:** 
- Larger file sizes (1200KB vs potential 100KB optimized)
- Slower page loads, especially on mobile
- Higher bandwidth costs for users

**Recommendation:**
- Fix underlying Next.js Image optimization issue instead of using `unoptimized`
- Implement proper responsive images with srcset
- Consider WebP format for better compression
- Set up image CDN (Supabase Storage already provides this)

#### Issue 10.2: No Prefetching of Product Details
**Problem:** When hovering over product cards, detail page isn't prefetched.

**Why It Matters:** Users experience lag when clicking through to products.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `prefetch={true}` to Link components on product cards
- Implement on-hover prefetch: `onMouseEnter={() => router.prefetch(`/product/${id}`)}`
- Prefetch critical CSS/JS for product pages

#### Issue 10.3: Large Bundle Size from Client Components
**Problem:** Many components marked 'use client' when they could be server components.

**Why It Matters:** Increases JavaScript bundle size, slows initial page load.

**Recommendation:**
- Audit which components truly need client interactivity
- Keep client boundary as low as possible (e.g., only the interactive parts)
- Example: ProductCard could be server component with client-only sub-components

#### Issue 10.4: Redundant Stock Checks
**Problem:** Stock checked both when adding to cart AND when loading cart page.

**Why It Matters:** Extra API calls slow down user experience, waste server resources.

**Recommendation:**
- Cache stock check results in sessionStorage for 2-3 minutes
- Only re-check stock at critical moments (before payment)
- Show stock level with last-checked timestamp
- Implement polling only when cart is visible

#### Issue 10.5: No Optimistic UI Updates
**Problem:** Adding to cart waits for API response before showing feedback.

**Why It Matters:** Users perceive the app as slow even if API is fast.

**Recommendation:**
- Update cart count immediately (optimistically)
- Show toast immediately
- Roll back if API call fails
- Same for wishlist add/remove actions

#### Issue 10.6: Font Loading Not Optimized
**Problem:** Inter font loaded via Google Fonts without preloading or fallback strategy.

**Why It Matters:** Flash of invisible text (FOIT) or flash of unstyled text (FOUT) delays perceived load time.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `preload` to font in layout.tsx
- Use font-display: swap in font definition
- Define fallback font stack: `font-family: Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`
- Consider self-hosting fonts for better control

#### Issue 10.7: No Request Deduplication
**Problem:** Multiple components may request same product data simultaneously.

**Why It Matters:** Wastes bandwidth and server resources with duplicate queries.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement React Query or SWR for automatic request deduplication
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Use server components for initial data fetching when possible
